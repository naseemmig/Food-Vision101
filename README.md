Transfer Learning using TensorFlow
Overview
This project demonstrates how to implement Transfer Learning using TensorFlow, one of the most popular machine learning libraries. Transfer Learning allows us to leverage the knowledge learned by a pre-trained model on a large dataset to solve a different but related task with a smaller dataset, greatly improving efficiency and accuracy in machine learning tasks.

In this project, we will:

Load a pre-trained model (e.g., MobileNetV2, ResNet, or InceptionV3) from TensorFlow's Model Zoo.
Fine-tune this model on a custom dataset to perform a specific task (e.g., image classification).
Evaluate and visualize the performance of the fine-tuned model.
Key Features
Use of pre-trained models for feature extraction.
Fine-tuning of the pre-trained model to adapt it to a new dataset.
Efficient training with limited data resources.
Utilization of TensorFlow's high-level API, Keras, for simplicity.
Model evaluation and visualizations of training progress using Matplotlib.
Requirements
To run this project, you'll need the following dependencies:

Python 3.x
TensorFlow 2.x
NumPy
Matplotlib
scikit-learn (for data preprocessing)

Dataset
For this example, we have used a sample dataset of images for classification, but you can replace it with any dataset of your choice. The dataset should be structured in a way that it is compatible with Keras ImageDataGenerator or tf.data.Dataset.

Pre-trained Models
In this project, we provide support for various pre-trained models, including:

MobileNetV2
ResNet50
InceptionV3
EfficientNet
You can easily switch between models by modifying the configuration in the code.

Fine-Tuning Strategy
We first freeze the base layers of the pre-trained model, so they are not updated during the initial training phase. Once the top layers are trained, we unfreeze a few of the deeper layers of the base model and fine-tune them to further improve performance on the new task.

Results
After training, you will see:

Training and validation accuracy and loss curves.
Final model accuracy on the validation set.
Confusion matrix and classification report (if applicable).
